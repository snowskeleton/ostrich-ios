OSTRich is the Open Source Tournament Reporter.

Join events, submit results, and track what players bring over time.
Never leave home with dead sideboard cards again, thanks to our Metagame tracker, which lets you see exactly what your local shop plays.

With a full view into the event, you can see standings every round, check who’s still playing (and go nag them to speed up!), and record your scouting so you’re prepared for the next round. Tournament Organizers can use OSTRich to submit match results for players.

Integrating directly with EventLink and the Companion App, there’s no need for other players to use OSTRich; start tracking your play and gain the edge!
